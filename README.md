# ALec
ALec is a mobile and web application designed to tackle the issues of low student engagement and interaction within the classroom environment. This innovative solution empowers lecturers to enhance the learning experience by incorporating small quizzes during their lectures.

With ALec, lecturers can effortlessly administer quizzes, and students can easily respond using their smartphones, providing real-time feedback on their comprehension of the lecture material. This enables lecturers to gain immediate insights into students' knowledge and understanding, allowing them to tailor their teaching approach accordingly.

One of the standout features of ALec is its anonymous question-asking functionality. Students can submit questions through the app without revealing their identity, encouraging even the shyest individuals to actively participate and contribute to class discussions. This promotes a more inclusive and interactive learning environment.

In addition to its engagement-enhancing features, ALec offers a comprehensive platform for self-evaluation. Students can utilize the built-in leaderboard and review system to evaluate their progress, identify areas of improvement, and track their performance over time. This self-assessment aspect motivates students to pay closer attention to the course content and take an active role in their own learning journey.

ALec leverages a range of technologies to deliver its powerful capabilities. The application is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, ensuring a robust and reliable foundation. These technologies enable seamless cross-platform functionality, allowing both mobile and web access to maximize accessibility and convenience.

By strengthening the interaction between lecturers and students, ALec streamlines communication and enhances efficiency for both parties.
